Usage:
------
Let's say we have PostsController and Post model. We want to list all posts
from category 1 and category 2 on one page.

1) Load the component and the helper

  class PostsController extends AppController
  {
      public $components = array ('Listing.Listing');
      public $helpers = array ('Listing.Listing');
      ...

2) You need a parameter where the information about current page, etc. will be
   stored. So add it to your custom route in the config/routes.php - it must be
   named 'listingVars'. (Note: This is the main trick of this plugin - it uses
   only one parameter for everything - this parameter is actualy a serialized
   array, encoded with base64_encode. It contains current page and sorting for
   all listings on the page. That's why you can use multiple arrays easily.)

  Router::connect('/all-posts/:listingVars', array ('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'listAll'));

3) Now make your listing method in your model (models/post.php)
